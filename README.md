# Usage/Examples

```shell
node Tests.js

# Considerations
- The goal of this Repository with Tests and Exercises was to organize some of my Experience in JavaScript developed over some years.
- Most of the tests and exercises were coded in ECMAScript 2016;
- Some functions can suffer some updates, please consider checking Official Documentation from [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
